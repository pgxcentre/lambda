# A python script to compute genomic inflation factor

`compute_lambda.py` is small script to compute lambda (the genomic inflation
factor) from a GWAS result.


## Dependencies

The tool requires a standard [Python](http://python.org/) installation (version
2 or 3) with the following packages:

1. [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) version 0.17 or latest

The tool has been tested on *Linux* only, but should also work on both Mac OSX
and Windows.


## Usage

Using either `python` or `python3`:

```console
$ python compute_lambda.py --help
usage: compute_lambda.py [-h] [-v] -i FILE [FILE ...] [-d DELIM] -f NAME
                         [--snp-field NAME] [--chi2] [--p-value] [--one-sided]
                         [-e FILE]

Compute inflation factor (lambda) in GWAS results.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

INPUT FILES:
  -i FILE [FILE ...], --input FILE [FILE ...]
                        The list of files containing GWAS results.
  -d DELIM, --delim DELIM
                        The field delimiter (default is a tabulation).
  -f NAME, --field NAME
                        The name of the field containing the statistics.
  --snp-field NAME      The name of the field containing the SNP name.

GENERAL OPTIONS:
  --chi2                Statistics were computed using a chi-squared
                        distribution.
  --p-value, -p         Flag to use the p-value instead of the statistic. This
                        assumes a standard normal distribution for the test
                        statistic.
  --one-sided           Flag for one-sided tests (when using p-values to
                        compute the inflation factor

SUBSET OPTIONS:
  -e FILE, --extract FILE
                        A file containing markers to extract for the analysis
                        (only one marker per line).
```
